## Landing Page with Bootstrap

This landing page project was my first time using Bootstrap, a popular front-end development library. It allowed me to create a responsive and visually appealing layout quickly and efficiently.

Throughout the project, I gained valuable experience working with Bootstrap's grid system, responsive design, and its extensive collection of pre-built components. This project helped me to improve my front-end development skills and prepared me for future projects with Bootstrap.
